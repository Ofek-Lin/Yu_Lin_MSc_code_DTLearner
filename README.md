# Yu_Lin_MSc_code_DTLearner
This repository is used to store the code for DTLearner model from MSc Thesis.

This part should follow the previous part (i.e. [code_omics](https://github.com/Ofek-Lin/Yu_Lin_MSc_code_omics.git)) which contains essential function and data.
All the data used for the analysis can be found in the repository where the first part is kept.

Data have been organized and can be accessed via https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pkkPL2qP8TPXNJGwJg244v1lNM3S4lib?usp=share_link.
In your working directory, there should be a 'data' folder with all the datasets
'PG_data' folder: all the pre-generated data
'PG_data/GSEA_result' folder: all the GSEA output data
